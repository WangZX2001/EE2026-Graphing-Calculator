WARNING: [DRC DPOP-2] MREG Output pipelining: DSP u_graph/poly_q_return1__7 multiplier stage u_graph/poly_q_return1__7/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.
